# Drawing Shapes App

## React components and technique
On react side the followign techniques are used:
`useState` allows to manage drawn shape for color change, transformation and selection id

`selectedShapesIndex` controls the selcted shape and applied trnasformation

`useRef` event for HTML buttons to interact with React and canvas element - here utilized with Transform button, when pressed allows for shapes transformation

Mouse movement  `onMouseDown`, `onMouseMove`, and `onMouseUp` handle user interaction with canvas, allows also for preview of the shape 

## Application component architecture
There are components like `<Stage>`, `<Stage>`, `<Layer>`, `<Rect>`, `<Circle>`, `<Line>` to manage specific function to visualize and set up the workspace and shapes

Shapes are then rendered accordinigly to those states of selected shapes

## React libraries
`react-konva` for layers and shape trasformation
Transformation used from Konva methods are: Moving shapes, transforming size, moving backwards or forwards and clearing canvas

`react-color` for color selection tool

`react-pro-sidebar` for sidebar

## Saving and Loading the drawing

Saving the drawing -> save the shapes array to JSON string
file format: `JSON`



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
